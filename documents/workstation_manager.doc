Purpose

The RESA work station manager provides for secure central control of graphical Xwindows work stations.
Central control includes starting, stopping and automatic periodic status checking.
There is no need for system account creation for RESA gamers or controllers.

Security

To improve security, RESA gamers and controllers are not required to have a system account to use a RESA workstation.
The person running the Workstation Manager must sign on to the system and take responsibility for proper use of remote workstations.
All RESA orders entered by gamers and controllers are timestamped and logged.

A secure graphical Xwindows interface between server and client is used.

Steps for Use

The person running the workstation manager must sign on and go to the game directory
A workstation definition file must be created before starting stations.
Create three terminal windows and label station start, station stop and station status.
A scenario must be active before stations can be successfully started.
Execute stastart and stastatus in separate windows.
Monitor status of workstations.
If station status is abnormal(~), stop station and then start station.  Coordinate with gamer/controller.
If RESA is restarting from a save, all stations must be stopped prior to restarting.

Workstation definition file

The workstation definition file must reside in game directory with name stadef.dat.
A line beginning with ! is a comment line echoed to terminal.
A line beginning with # is a comment line not echoed to terminal.
Each line defines a station.
Each field in a line is separated by one or more spaces.
Each station definition contains the following required and optional fields:
   Station Number between 1 and 64 unless number of stations are reduced for scenario.
